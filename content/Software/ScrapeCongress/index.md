## ScrapeCongress Package

I created a package that you can use to scrape tweets from members of the 116th Congress. I am looking to make the functions a bit more efficient so that it loads faster. I am also looking to clean it up to publish to CRAN. For now, you can download 'ScrapeCong' from my github. 

```{r install}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('damoncharlesroberts/ScrapeCongress')
```
You can find information about the Package and it's functions on [my Github](https://github.com/DamonCharlesRoberts/ScrapeCong)
