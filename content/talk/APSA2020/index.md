summary: 
abstract: "Political language often has gendered connotations, both in the topics politicians
talk about, but also in the words they use. Using a validated dictionary of 700
words rated on the dimension of masculinity and femininity, we analyze approximately
27,000 public statements and interviews of U.S. Senators. We expect that
Republicans will use more masculine language than Democrats, and that women
will use more feminine language than men. We additionally expect that the effect
of partisanship on the use of masculine or feminine language will be larger than
the effect of gender of the speaker. Taking advantage of the depth and breadth of
data collected on what US Senators tweet, we use a word2vec embedding neural
network to identify similar words to those in the dictionary. This expansion gives
us a more complete view of the masculine and feminine language that does not rely
wholly on ratings from coders."
