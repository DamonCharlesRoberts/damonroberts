# Summary of Project
- Coauthored with Stephen M. Utych
- Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges across the world in getting citizens to change their behaviors in response to a public health crisis. In the United States, it appears that partisan differences in willingness to comply with these measures has emerged: Democrats are typically more supportive than Republicans in their stated support of, and willingness to comply with, these measures. However, actual behaviors are notoriously difficult to measure using survey data, and behavioral intention measures may be genuine intentions, may be overreported due to social desirability bias, or may be expressive responding in support of one’s ideology. Using personal device data, we find that county-level partisanship predicts aggregate level compliance with social distancing behavior – citizens of counties that are more Republican spend more time away from home than Democratic counties.
